# Always Works™ Prompt

## Task

Fix proofs / theorems in `FloatSpec/src/Core/__PLACEHOLDER__`.

## Goal

Repair **exactly one** item: `__LOCATION__`

---

## Prerequisites (read first)

* `FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md` (overall pipeline)
* `./CLAUDE.md` (proof-writing conventions and `mvcgen` info)

---

## Process (ONE-BY-ONE, compile after each step)

1. **Identify target** following the Goal and record the exact line number and reason (error/sorry/unsolved goals).
2. **Understand spec & code**

   * Verify the definition body (if relevant) matches intent and source (Coq).
   * Review the local spec/Hoare triples and nearby lemmas.
3. **Plan**: decide whether to prove directly or factor helper lemmas (preferred for long proofs).
4. **Draft Implement**

   * Add minimal helper lemmas (use `private` or local `namespace`).
   * Follow house style; use `Zaux.lean`’s `Zfast_div_eucl_spec` and in-file patterns as templates.
   * Do not attempt to skip or bypass the proof: `axiom`, `admit`, `pure true`, or any non-`sorry` placeholder (including `pure (decide True)`, `pure (decide ((0 : ℝ) ≤ 0))`, and all variants which could be easily deducted to a `True`) are strictly forbidden.
5. **Check Implement**: review your changes to ensure no forbidden placeholders were introduced. To be specific:
    * Search the diff for `axiom`, `admit`, `pure true`, `pure (decide True)`, `pure (decide ((0 : ℝ) ≤ 0))`, and all variants which could be easily deducted to a `True`.
    * If you find any of these placeholders, revert all the related changes and work from beginning.
    * If the search did not find any of these placeholders, apply the patch and proceed to the next step.
6. **Compile**: `lake build` immediately after the change.

   * Fix all reported errors before making more changes.
7. **Polish**: refactor only if it **reduces** proof fragility and aligns with the Coq source.
8. **Log**: update the change log (see “Change Log & Reporting”).

> Never batch multiple risky edits. Build early, build often.

## Allowed vs. Prohibited Changes

**Allowed (with restraint)**

* Introduce small, well-named helper lemmas.
* Reorder theorems **only** to resolve clear dependency cycles—and log it.
* Minimal spec tweaks **only if** the Coq original demands it (see below).

**Prohibited**

* Deleting any existing theorems/functions.
* Using `axiom`, `admit`, `pure true`, or any non-`sorry` placeholder, including `pure (decide True)`, `pure (decide ((0 : ℝ) ≤ 0))`, and all variants which could be easily deducted to a `True`. If you see such placeholders, replace them with `sorry` instead.
* Expanding scope beyond the **single selected** target.
* Broad spec rewrites or syntax changes to Hoare triples (unless strictly required by the Coq source and documented).

---

## If the Theorem/Spec Seems Wrong

1. Compare with the original Coq statement/proof in `/home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core`.
2. If a mismatch **blocks** the Lean proof:

   * Update the Lean statement **minimally** to match the Coq intent.
   * Port the relevant argument/structure from Coq.
   * **Record every change** in the change log with justification and Coq references.

---

## Proof Strategy Guidelines

* Prefer decomposition: prove small lemmas, then assemble.
* Use existing proven lemmas from imports and `mathlib4` where available; if uncertain, search first, otherwise implement locally.
* Keep terms and rewriting explicit; avoid fragile tactic scripts.
* Preserve existing notation and Hoare triple syntax whenever possible.

---

## Compilation & Completion Criteria

* After **every** change: run `lake build` (capture logs).
* **Definition of Complete** for this task:

  * The selected target theorem is fully proven (no `sorry`, no `axiom` or other placeholders, no unsolved goals).
  * The repository compiles cleanly (errors = 0).
  * No unrelated theorems were altered, deleted, or broken.
* Warnings may remain; do **not** chase them unless they block the proof.

---

## Change Log & Reporting (mandatory)

Append an entry to a markdown file (e.g., `docs/FloatSpec-ProofChanges.md`) with:

```
## File: FloatSpec/src/Core/__PLACEHOLDER__
- Target: <theorem/def name> at line <n>
- Reason picked: <error|sorry|unsolved goals>
- Approach: <direct proof | helper lemmas (list) | ported from Coq (list)>
- Changes:
  - [ ] Definition modified? (yes/no). If yes, minimal diff + reason.
  - [ ] Spec modified? (yes/no). If yes, minimal diff + Coq reference path.
  - [ ] Reordering done? (yes/no). If yes, explain dependency.
- Coq reference(s): /home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core/<file>.v : <lines/lemma names>
- Build: <command used> | <log file path>
- Notes: pitfalls, invariants, future useful lemmas (if any)
```

If the file had no target (no errors, no `sorry`), write a brief “No-action report”.

---

## Practical Tips

* Save build output to a log and search it instead of scrolling:

  * Example: `lake build 2>&1 | tee .log/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_build.log`
* When adding lemmas, colocate near the target or in a `private` section to avoid polluting the API.
* If a `def` is `sorry` and the function is hard to realize: inline the needed facts into the theorem (as in the Coq proof), **clear** the `def`’s `sorry` via a correct implementation or restructure to avoid relying on a bogus placeholder—then prove the theorem.
* Look for definition in the imports and opens before actually implementing it. If the definition is already in the imports or opens, just use it directly and aviod duplicate definition.
* Change order within file is permitted only to resolve dependency cycles. If you do reorder, document it. If the dependency you need is in another file, check if the import will cause a dependency cycle; if so, do not reorder and check the coq original source and use the proof Strategy from there.

## Recap Checklist (ALL must be checked and achieved before you stop)

* [ ] Applied Selection Rule; recorded line+reason.
* [ ] Read PIPELINE/CLAUDE docs.
* [ ] Implemented proof (or minimal Coq-aligned spec tweak).
* [ ] No `axiom`/`admit`/`pure true`; no new `sorry`. Check by searching the diff to make sure you did not introduce any of these. If you did introduce any of these, revert all the related changes and work from beginning.
* [ ] Ran `scripts/audit_placeholders.sh --json FloatSpec` and recorded the result.
* [ ] Emitted or updated a structured attempt record with `scripts/classify_attempt.py`.
* [ ] `lake build` succeeds without error.
* [ ] Change log entry added with Coq references.

**Be persistent.** If you can’t close the main target within this session, leave behind **useful, compiling helper lemmas** that clearly reduce the remaining gap—and document them in the change log.
