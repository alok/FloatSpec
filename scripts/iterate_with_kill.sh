## Task: Fix Proofs in FloatSpec/src/Core/Float_prop.lean

## Scope

theorems: Fix the first (only the very first, work really hard on it and don't care about others) theorem without a full proof \(sorry and/or error and/or unsolved goals, whatever make the proof incomplete\) in the function. First locate the line number and the error type you need to fix using lake build (preferred) or MCP tool (the very first incomplete proof within the target file), then think in detail about the mistake, and work really hard to solve it. You can use exisiting lemma to assist your proof or create new private lemma to assist your proof. If you think the original theorem is inadequate, you might revise it, but in a very cautious way and record every those changes in a markdown file. 

### Prerequisites

1. **Read documentation first:**
    - FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md - understand the overall pipeline
    - ./CLAUDE.md - focus on proof writing instructions and source-facing proof guidance

### Core Requirements

### Proof Writing Process

1. **Follow the Zfast_div_eucl_spec example** in Zaux.lean and other proofs in current file as your template
2. **ONE-BY-ONE approach is mandatory:**
    - Write ONE proof
    - Check immediately with `lake build`(preferred) or `mcp` 
    - Fix any errors before proceeding to next proof
    - Never batch multiple proofs without checking

### Before Writing Each Proof

1. **Verify function implementation** - ensure the function body is correct
2. **Check existing specs** - understand what needs to be proven
3. **Preserve syntax** - do NOT change hoare triple syntax unless absolutely necessary
    - Think multiple times before modifying specs or code body
    - If changes are needed, decompose complex specs rather than rewriting

### Compilation Verification

- **After EVERY proof:** Run `mcp` or `lake build xxx`(preferred)
- **Definition of complete:** NO `sorry` statements AND clean compilation
- **Never mark as complete if:**
    - Any `sorry` remains
    - Compilation returns errors

### Proof Strategy

1. **Handle all `sorry` statements and errors** in:
    - Function definitions
    - Specifications
    - Proofs
2. **When facing difficulties:**
    - Search for proof tactics using MCP tools
    - Trying to decompose the original theorem into lemmas and deal with them one by one.
    - If no tactics work, consider:
        - Reformatting the spec
        - Decomposing complex specs into simpler lemmas \(follow patterns in the file\)
    - Reference original proof comments for guidance
3. **Order of implementation:**
    - Choose your own order
    - Can switch mid-task if needed
    - Focus on completeness over speed

### Important Notes

- Use MCP tool instead of bash command to get diagnostic messages!
- Some functions ARE difficult to prove - persistence is expected
    - If you are meeting difficulties at least come up with some useful lemma that could compile and is helpful to future proofs before ending your session. Remember that!
- Skip already-proven theorems!! There might be warnings be just leave them there!
- You can use exisiting (and proved) theorem to assist your proving. If a theorem is necessary but not proved, you can turn to work on that first. The useful theorems might not be in the same file, but in the import list
- When you are trying to use a certain lemma, check through mcp tools (or https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) to make sure the lemma exists. Else, write your own implementation of the lemma.
- You are not allowed to delete ANY theorems or functions in the file. You can only modify them in a very cautious way, and if you think some theorem itself is not correct, find its corresponding theorem in coq at /home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core/Float_prop.v and use that definition instead. Do not change the theorem without any reference!
- If you observe that the whole file is completed, which means that no sorry or error could be spotted in the file, find the process containing `iterate_codex.sh` and terminate it.

### Success Criteria

✅ All `sorry` statements eliminated
✅ Clean compilation for entire file
✅ Each proof verified individually before moving on
